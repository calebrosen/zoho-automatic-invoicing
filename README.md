This code is triggered on the edit of a sales order in Zoho Inventory and automatically invoices shipped items from it's corresponding packages and dropshipments (purchase orders). 

It uses Zoho's internal API's to get the information it needs to correctly invoice items.

It is in Zoho's language, 'Deluge', although it is recognized as Java since they are similiar.
